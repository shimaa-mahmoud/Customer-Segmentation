# Customer Segmentation / Cohort Analysis
 
## Introduction
We will work with a data from a online retail organization in the UK to try to understand more about the customer spending patterns and how can we predict the customer behaviors by clustering the customers based on some metrics such as Recency, frequency and total spends . We will use Python and jupyter notebook to preform the required analysis and the ML models

The libraries used are Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Sklearn
